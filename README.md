# Hey Palette

So you've got a color palette in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and you've used the [Figma Tokens plugin](https://docs.tokens.studio/) to export that palette to JSON. This little utility app renders your palette and search for the nearest palette match for any given hex code.

If you'd like to bring your own data, just replace the `data/color-tokens.json` file with your own [Figma Tokens](https://docs.tokens.studio/) export - as long as it matches the existing schema you're good to go.

## Development

Start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
