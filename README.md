# Hey Palette

So you've got a color palette in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and you've used the [Figma Tokens plugin](https://docs.tokens.studio/) to export that palette to JSON. Let's say you have a color that's not in the palette, but you want to find the _nearest_ match in the palette. That's what this little toy app is for!

## Development

Start the dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

CD is set up on the `main` branch. Commits to main will trigger automated deploys to Vercel.
